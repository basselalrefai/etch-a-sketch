# Etch-a-sketch || TOP
Hello ! This is a JS project I made while doing [The Odin Project's course](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/foundations/lessons/etch-a-sketch-project), just open this [link](https://basselalrefai.github.io/etch-a-sketch/) and hover your mouse to start sketching! BTW: you can make the grid you want using the reset grid button.
